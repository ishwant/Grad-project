Getting started
===============

The production Xcode project has been provided as-is with the following exceptions:

1. Diabetik makes use of [Shinobi Charts](http://www.shinobicontrols.com/shinobicharts/), a proprietary charting framework that cannot legally be redistributed. As such, developers wishing to compile the Diabetik source code will need to download a trial version of the framework.
2. Certain private credentials have been stripped from the public codebase to ensure they remain secure. Placeholder credentials can be found in the UACredentials-Example.h header file. Rename it UACredentials.h before compiling the project.

Legal stuff
===========

The Diabetik source code is provided under version 2.0 of the Apache License. While we have included various multimedia assets it is important to note that these require express written consent if they are to be included as part of any derivative work.
